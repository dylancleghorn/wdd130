                <p>Hello! My name is Dylan Cleghorn and I'm from Dallas, Texas.
                <p>I'm currently studying Web Development at BYU-Idaho. </p>
                <p>I currently work as an Advisory Consultant for a software company called Archer Technologies that
                    makes enterprise risk and compliance applications.</p>
                <p>In my free time, I like to write and perform music, play golf, and travel.</p>

        <h2>The great state of Texas</h2>
        <div class="content-section">

            <div>
                <p> Missouri is great and all, but Texas is the true Zion.</p>
                <p>Wilford Woodruff recorded in his journal that the Prophet Joseph Smith said "that when the City of
                    Enoch
                    fled & was translated it was [where] the Gulf of [America] now is. It left that gulf a body of
                    water."
                </p>
                <p>Since the Gulf of America is an extension of Texas' coast, this proves that Texas was the original
                    Zion.</p>
